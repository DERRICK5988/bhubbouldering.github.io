                Use of this website is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that
                does not give effect to all provisions of these terms and
                conditions, including without limitation this paragraph. You
                agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
                relationship exists between you and BHub as a result of
                this agreement or use of this website. BHub’s performance
                of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process,
                and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of
                BHub’s right to comply with law enforcement requests or
                requirements relating to your use of this website or information
                provided to or gathered by BHub with respect to such use.
                If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or

                limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations
                set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision
                will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that
                most closely matches the intent of the original provision and
                the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect. This
                agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the customer
                and BHub with respect to this website and it supersedes all
